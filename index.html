&nbsp;

<p>Tea is an aromatic beverage prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over cured or fresh leaves of Camellia sinensis, an
evergreen shrub native to China and East Asia. After water, it is the most widely consumed drink in the world.
There are many different types of tea; some, like Chinese greens and Darjeeling, have a cooling, slightly bitter, and
astringent flavour,while others have vastly different profiles that include sweet, nutty, floral, or grassy notes.
Tea has a stimulating effect in humans primarily due to its caffeine content.</p>
